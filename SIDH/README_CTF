This directory now contains two more binaries: `local_attack` and `extract`.

extract just does the work of computing an SSL pre-master secret given the
client public and server private keys and is actually used in the attack.

local_attack implements a bunch of tests done along the way to verify that the
library is working how we think it is, and then simulates a local version of
the attack described in secton 3 of [1] ("Adapative attack") to make sure we
know how to do it, given an oracle.  All the heavy lifting is done by MakeEvil,
which calls ladder2, an implementation (heavily cribbed from ladder_3pt)
of the Montgomery ladder on one EC point for computing [n]P for a point P
in Montgomery form.

The functions from local_attack that did the actual work were then ported into
the openssl patch for SIDH and given an interface accessible through s_client.

Probably you want to build with `make ARCH=x64 ASM=false` but I'm not the boss
of you.
